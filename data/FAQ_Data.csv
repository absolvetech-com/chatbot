Therefore the topper (highest score) of each session will get the same Percentile of 100 which is desirable. The marks obtained in between the highest and lowest scores are also converted to appropriate Percentiles. 
The Percentile score will be the Normalized Score for the examination (instead of the raw marks of the candidate) and shall be used for preparation of the merit lists. The Percentile Scores will be calculated up to 7 decimal places to avoid bunching effect and reduce ties. The Percentile score of a Candidate is calculated as follows: 100 X Number of candidates appeared in the „Session‟ with raw score EQUAL TO OR LESS than the candidate Total number of the candidates appeared in the ‟Session‟ Note: The Percentile of the Total shall NOT be an aggregate or average of the Percentile of individual subject.
